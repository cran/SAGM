Description: Implements the methodological developments found in Hermes, van Heerwaarden, and Behrouzi (2023) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.04325>, and allows for the statistical modeling of asymmetric between-location effects, as well as within-location effects using spatial autoregressive graphical models. The package allows for the generation of spatial weight matrices to capture asymmetric effects for strip-type intercropping designs, although it can handle any type of spatial data commonly found in other sciences.
